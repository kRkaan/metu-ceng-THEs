# Bomberman Game Project

## Overview
This is a C program for a simple text-based Bomberman game. The game consists of a maze, where multiple players (bombers) can move, plant bombs, and attempt to eliminate each other. The last remaining player wins the game.

## Code Structure
- `main.c`: Contains the main game loop and logic.
- `README.md`: This README file.
- `bomb`: Executable for bomb explosions.
- Other C files (not included in this code snippet) should contain specific functions used in the main game loop.

## Compilation and Execution
Compile the code using a C compiler. For example:

```shell
gcc main.c -o bomberman
