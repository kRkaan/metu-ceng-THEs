# Programming Languages Homeworks

This repository contains a series of programming assignments that cover various programming languages and paradigms.

## Haskell

### THE 1 - Recipe Calculator
In this programming assignment, you will use Haskell to construct a recipe calculator system. This system keeps track of recipes, ingredients, and generates shopping lists for convenient management. You will implement five Haskell functions to achieve this goal.

### THE 2 - Dungeon Crawler Game
In this Haskell programming assignment, you'll build planning functions for a dungeon crawler game. Lead a group of adventurers exploring a cave and decide whether to explore the cave, choose a path, and decide on a strategy to maximize gold with minimal effort. You will implement five Haskell functions to assist in making these decisions.

### THE 3 - Mathematical Function Calculator
This Haskell programming assignment involves building a "calculator" for basic mathematical functions using types and typeclasses. You'll represent mathematical functions using custom data types and extend their functionality by making instances of several typeclasses. This assignment consists of three parts, each explained in detail in homework PDF.

## C++

### THE 4 - Automatic Differentiation
In this programming assignment, object-oriented paradigms, including polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance are implemented to create an automatic-differentiation system (auto-grad) in C++. The system handles expression trees of polynomials, performs complex operations like gradient calculation, and evaluation under constraints.

### THE 5 - Band Tournament
This program is a practice of object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The task is to create a band tournament involving four different types of bands: RockBand, JazzBand, MetalBand, and KPopBand.

## Prolog

### THE 6 - City Council Elections
In this Prolog programming assignment, the program runs a city council election. The assignment involves merging two competing cities, Pawnee and Eagleton, into one city council. The knowledge base includes predicates like `party`, `candidate`, `elected`, and `to_elect`.

Each homework assignment directory contains detailed instructions in homework PDFs and resources specific to that assignment. Please refer to the respective folders for more information and implementation details.
