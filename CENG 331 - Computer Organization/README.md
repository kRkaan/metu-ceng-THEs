# Computer Organization Labs

## Bomb Lab
The Bomb Lab is an exciting challenge focused on reverse engineering and binary exploitation. Your task is to defuse a series of binary "bombs" by analyzing their assembly code, identifying vulnerabilities, and crafting inputs to disarm them. This lab helps you develop skills in debugging, assembly language, and vulnerability analysis.

## Attack Lab
In the Attack Lab, you'll explore software vulnerabilities and practice buffer overflow attacks. You'll learn how to exploit security weaknesses in programs, manipulate memory, and execute malicious code. This lab is a valuable introduction to cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

## Architecture Lab
The Architecture Lab dives into the fundamentals of computer architecture. You'll study the inner workings of a simplified processor and gain insights into how instructions are executed at the hardware level. This lab enhances your understanding of computer organization and low-level programming.

## Performance Lab
The Performance Lab focuses on performance analysis and optimization. You'll examine and optimize code snippets to make them run faster and use resources more efficiently. This lab provides valuable experience in profiling, benchmarking, and optimizing software for speed and resource usage.
