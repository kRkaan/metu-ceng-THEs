Some of the homeworks I have done at METU ceng. \
  These may not be the most efficient solutions, or may not work for all cases, even though I've got 100 on them. If you find something important for the runtime or simplicity of the code, especially for some parts of the code I wrote that the function implementation would be better than copy-pasting the code, if there is anything with that issue in any of the files, you may assume that I am aware of the problem, but other than that, please reach me. Also, I tried to explain some of the programs with comments, but if they are not enough for you, I can try to explain them, if you reach out to me.
